Task requirements:
* Use any public API or make own to load JSON with 5000+ records
* Use vanilla js or any framework you like to implement data representation table (at least 3 columns)

* Click on any column header it should sort the table by particular column, next click should reverse order.

* Add pagination. Leave the possibility to see all records at once.

* Output last clicked table cell data somewhere on the screen outside table. Change color of last clicked row.

* Have a strong concern about performance

* Commit source to a public repository (GitHub) and send the link

* Would be nice to have a live demo online
